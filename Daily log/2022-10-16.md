Today I installed obsidian, i am planning to use this markdown notebook application to store documents about all my projects and work, this way i never have to learn things twice.

I will also store the obsidian vault on github under the name `justlucdewit/docs`. This way I will be able to reach my documentation from any device, including at work.

I started out today with writing some documents on the AVM [[Opcodes]].

After that, I decided I needed to kinda up the pace for my RMS API remake project in haxe, so i worked on some endpoints for that, specifically the endpoints for management of users.

I also wrote some documentation on [[Setting up BC development environment]] and a lot of docker documentation ([[Installing docker]])
