To open the bios on windows 10, you can:
- Click the start icon in the bottom left.
- Click on the power icon
- Hold shift while clicking restart

Then you will be presented with a blue screen with some options, click `Troubleshoot > Advanced options > UEFI Firmware settings`. Now you will be taken to your BIOS.

### Help, the UEFI Firmware settings option doesnt exist for me
Sometimes windows decides to not show the UEFI Firmware settings, in that case you are going to need to manually open the BIOS by restarting your PC and while its booting, hold down the key needed for opening the BIOS.

Unfortuntately this key differs from PC to PC, but often its either Del, or Esc, or any of the function keys f1 - f12
