Sometimes you want to check your windows version, for example when you take remote control over some (virtual) remote server. Especially when working with Business central, its seems to be pretty important what windows version you are running.

### Steps
To do this, do the following:
- click the windows icon on the bottom left
- type winver
- run winver.exe

### Command line
You can do the same thing on the command line by just using the `winver` command in CMD

You will see a popup showing the specific windows version installed on the current system.
