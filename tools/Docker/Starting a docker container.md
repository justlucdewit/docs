### Using Docker desktop
To start a container in docker desktop, you have to navigate to `containers` in the navigator, and you will be presented with a list of containers in a table. The last column of each row has some action buttons, one of which is a triangular play button.

If you press that play button, it will start that specific container.

### Using the CLI
You can also start a container using the docker CLI in a console window. You can do this using the command: `docker start <container_name>`. The `<container_name>` part must be replaced by the name of the container that you want to start, which can be found in the container listing [[Listing all containers]]
